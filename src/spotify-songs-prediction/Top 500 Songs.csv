Like a Rolling Stone,"""I wrote it. I didn't fail. It was straight,"" Bob Dylan said of his greatest song shortly after he recorded it in June 1965.

(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction',"""It's the riff heard round the world,"" says Steve Van Zandt, guitarist for the E Street Band.

Imagine,"John Lennon wrote ""Imagine,"" his greatest musical gift to the world, one morning early in 1971 in his bedroom at Tittenhurst Park, his estate in Ascot, England. His wife, Yoko Ono, watched as Lennon sat at the white grand piano now known around the world from films and photographs of the sessions for his Imagine album and virtually completed the song: the serene melody; the pillowy chord progression; that beckoning, four-note figure; and nearly all of the lyrics, 22 lines of graceful, plain-spoken faith in the power of a world, united in purpose, to repair and change itself.",Imagine (Capitol/Apple),John Lennon,John Lennon,"Lennon, Phil Spector, Yoko Ono","October, 1971",9 weeks,No. 3
What's Going On,"""What's Going On"" is an exquisite plea for peace on Earth, sung by a man at the height of crisis. In 1970, Marvin Gaye was Motown's top male vocal star, yet he was frustrated by the assembly-line role he played on his own hits. Devastated by the loss of duet partner Tammi Terrell, who died that March after a three-year battle with a brain tumor, Gaye was also trapped in a turbulent marriage to Anna Gordy, Motown boss Berry Gordy's sister. Gaye was tormented, too, by his relationship with his puritanical father, Marvin Sr. ""If I was arguing for peace,"" Gaye told biographer David Ritz, ""I knew I'd have to find peace in my heart.""",What's Going On (Tamla),Marvin Gaye,"Gaye, Renaldo Benson, Al Cleveland",Gaye ,"Feb, 1971",13 weeks,No. 2
Respect,"Otis Redding wrote ""Respect"" and recorded it first, for the Volt label in 1965. But Aretha Franklin took possession of the song for all time with her definitive cover, made at Atlantic's New York studio on Valentine's Day 1967. ""Respect"" was her first Number One hit and the single that established her as the Queen of Soul. In Redding's reading, a brawny march, he called for equal favor with volcanic force. Franklin wasn't asking for anything. She sang from higher ground: a woman calling an end to the exhaustion and sacrifice of a raw deal with scorching sexual authority.

Good Vibrations,"""It scared me, the word 'vi-brations,'"" Brian Wilson once said, remembering how, when he was a boy, his mother, Audree, tried to explain why dogs barked at some people and not others. ""A dog would pick up vibrations from these people that you can't see but you can feel. And the same thing happened with people."" ""Good Vibrations"" harnessed that energy and turned it into eternal sunshine.

Johnny B. Goode,"""Johnny B. Goode"" was the first rock & roll hit about rock & roll stardom. It is still the greatest rock & roll song about the democracy of fame in pop music. And ""Johnny B.

I changed it to 'country boy' — or else it wouldn't get on the radio."" Berry took other narrative liberties. Johnny came from ""deep down in Louisiana, close to New Orleans,"" rather than Berry's St. Louis.

Hey Jude,"The Beatles' biggest U.S. single — nine weeks at Number One — was also their longest, at seven minutes and 11 seconds. During the recording sessions, producer George Martin objected to the length, claiming DJs would not play the song. ""They will if it's us,"" John Lennon shot back. Paul McCartney wrote ""Hey Jude"" in June 1968, singing to himself on his way to visit Lennon's soon-to-be-ex-wife, Cynthia, and their son, Julian. The opening lines were, McCartney once said, ""a hopeful message for Julian: 'Come on, man, your parents got divorced. I know you're not happy, but you'll be OK.'"" McCartney changed ""Jules"" to ""Jude"" — a name inspired by Jud from the musical Oklahoma! — and presented a demo tape to Lennon, who loved the song. He also thought McCartney was singing to him, about his relationship with Yoko Ono and the strains on the Lennon-McCartney partnership. But his self-centered reading underscored the universal comfort in McCartney's lyrics and the song's warm, rolling charm, fortified in the fade-out by a 36-piece orchestra whose members (with one grumpy exception) also clapped and sang along — for double their usual fee.",1 (Capitol/Apple) ,The Beatles,"John Lennon, Paul McCartney",George Martin,"Aug, 1968",19 weeks,No. 1
Smells Like Teen Spirit,"Producer Butch Vig first heard ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" in early 1991, on a boombox cassette recorded by bassist Krist Novoselic, drummer Dave Grohl and singer-guitarist-songwriter Kurt Cobain in a barn in Tacoma, Washington. The fidelity was abysmal. Vig — about to work with Nirvana on their major-label debut, Nevermind — could not tell that the song would soon make underground Seattle rock the new mainstream and catapult Cobain, a troubled young man with strict indie-culture ethics, into megacelebrity. ""I could sort of hear the 'Hello, hello' part and the chords,"" Vig said years later.

""Later on, people said it was vulgar,"" Charles continued, referring to that irresistible, sexually heated vocal bridge. ""But, hell, let's face it, everybody knows about the ummmmh, unnnnh.

My Generation,"The Who's guitarist, Pete Townshend, supposedly wrote ""My Generation,"" his immortal fuck-off to the elders in his way, on his 20th birthday, May 19th, 1965, while riding a train from London to Southampton for a television appearance. The song wasn't intended as a youth-mutiny anthem at first. It was a Jimmy Reed-style blues, reflecting Townshend's fears about the impending strictures of adult life, famously captured in the line ""Hope I die before I get old."" ""My Generation' was very much about trying to find a place in society,"" he told Rolling Stone in 1987. ""I was very, very lost. The band was young then. It was believed that its career would be incredibly brief."" Instead, ""My Generation"" became the Who's ticket to legend — their first British Top Five hit, and a battle cry for young mod rebels — and it established Townshend as a fearless and eloquent songwriter. ""My Generation"" went through months of arranging and rerecording before the Who got it right, in two takes, on October 13th, 1965. Townshend opened the song with a two-chord assault that beat punk rock to the punch by more than a decade. Bassist John Entwistle took the solo breaks with crisp, grunting aggression — he had to buy three new basses to finish the recording, since his Danelectro's strings kept breaking and replacement strings weren't available. (He ended up playing the song on a Fender.) Roger Daltrey's stuttering, howling performance, Townshend and Entwistle's R&B-inspired backing vocals, and the upward key changes created a vivid, mounting anxiety that climaxed with a studio re-creation of the Who's live gear-trashing finales, with Townshend spewing feedback all over Keith Moon's avalanche drumming. Four decades later, Townshend and Daltrey are all that remain of the original Who, and they still play ""My Generation"" at every show — now with the fire and wisdom of age.",My Generation (Universal) ,The Who,Pete Townshend,Shel Talmy,"Nov, 1965",5 weeks,No. 74
A Change Is Gonna Come,"In 1963, Sam Cooke — America's first great soul singer and one of the most successful pop acts in the nation, with 18 Top 30 hits since 1957 — heard a song that profoundly inspired and disturbed him: Bob Dylan's ""Blowin' in the Wind."" What struck Cooke was the challenge implicit in Dylan's anthem.

Yesterday,"Paul McCartney's greatest ballad holds a Guinness World Record as the most recorded song of all time; seven years later, there were 1,186 versions by artists as varied as Frank Sinatra, Otis Redding and Willie Nelson. But McCartney's original reading — cut on June 14th, 1965, at EMI's Abbey Road studios in London — remains the most beautiful and daring of all: a frank poem of regret scored and sung with haunted elegance. There are no other Beatles on the record. None were needed. George Martin's arrangement for a string quartet emphasized lower-octave melancholy, while McCartney's almost whispered vocal reverberated with longing in the big, dark spaces where drums and electric guitars would have been. The melody, he said, came to him in a dream: ""My dad used to know a lot of old jazz tunes, I thought maybe I'd just remembered it from the past."" McCartney auditioned the song for Martin, with the working title ""Scrambled Eggs,"" in a hotel room in Paris in January 1964 — before the Beatles had even landed in America — but would not record it for another year and a half. ""We were a little embarrassed about it,"" McCartney confessed. ""We were a rock & roll band."" A Number One single in America, ""Yesterday"" was, in his own words, ""the most complete song I have ever written.""",Help! (Capitol/Apple),The Beatles,"John Lennon, Paul McCartney",George Martin,"Sep, 1965",11 weeks,No. 1
Blowin' in the Wind,"In April 1962, at Gerde's Folk City in New York's Greenwich Village, 20-year-old Bob Dylan gave a quick speech before playing one of his new songs: ""This here ain't no protest song or anything like that, 'cause I don't write no protest songs,"" he said. Then he sang the first and third verses of the still-unfinished ""Blowin' in the Wind."" Published in full a month later in the folk journal Broadside and recorded on July 9th, 1962, for his second album, The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan, ""Blowin' in the Wind"" was Dylan's first important composition. It is also the most famous protest song ever written.",The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan (Columbia) ,Bob Dylan,Dylan,John Hammond,"May, 1963",Did not chart,
London Calling,"Named after the call signal of the BBC's World Service broadcasts, the title alarm of the Clash's third album was an SOS from the heart of darkness. When they recorded the song, the Clash — British punk's most political and uncompromising band — were without management and sinking in debt. Around them, Britain was suffocating in crisis: soaring unemployment, racial conflict, widespread drug use. ""We felt that we were struggling,"" Joe Strummer said, ""about to slip down a slope or something, grasping with our fingernails. And there was no one there to help us.""",London Calling (Epic) ,The Clash,"Mick Jones, Joe Strummer",Guy Stevens,"Jan, 1980",Did not chart,
I Want to Hold Your Hand,"As a young, struggling beat group, playing grueling gigs at grubby bars, the Beatles had an in-joke to cheer themselves up: declaring that they were going ""to the toppermost of the poppermost."" By 1963, they meant it enough to issue an ultimatum. ""We said to [manager] Brian Epstein, 'We're not going to America till we've got a Number One record,'"" Paul McCartney said. So he and John Lennon went to the home of the parents of Jane Asher, McCartney's girlfriend, where — ""one on one, eyeball to eyeball,"" as Lennon put it — they wrote ""I Want to Hold Your Hand,"" an irresistibly erotic come-on framed as a chaste, bashful request. The lightning-bolt energy of their collaboration ran through the band's performance, taped October 17th, 1963. It lunges out of the speakers with a rhythm so tricky that the first wave of bands to cover the song often couldn't figure it out; Lennon and McCartney constantly switch between unison and harmonies, both of them snapping and whooping like they own the melody. Every element of the song is a hook, from Lennon's Chuck Berry riffing to George Harrison's string-snapping guitar fills to the quartet's syncopated hand claps. With advance orders at a million copies, ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" was released in the U.K. in late November, and promptly bumped the band's own ""She Loves You"" from the top of the charts.",Meet the Beatles! (Capitol/Apple) ,The Beatles,"John Lennon, Paul McCartney",George Martin,"Dec, 1963",15 weeks,No. 1
Purple Haze,"It is one of the unforgettable opening riffs in rock: a ferocious, stomping guitar march, scarred with fuzz and built around the dissonant ""devil's interval"" of the tritone. And it launched not one but two revolutions: late-Sixties psychedelia and the unprecedented genius of Jimi Hendrix. For the first time, Hendrix, bassist Noel Redding and drummer Mitch Mitchell got to show off their acrobatic onstage chemistry on record — and they somehow managed to condense it to an under-three-minute blaze of overdubbed guitar sorcery. (The first chord of its main riff has come to be known among guitarists as the ""Hendrix chord."") The song, which Hendrix wrote on December 26th, 1966, in the dressing room of a London club, also served as a showcase for his brilliant, often contradictory lyrical gifts (boiled down from a much longer initial draft called ""Purple Haze — Jesus Saves""). He spiked the surging rhythmic confidence of the Experience with intimate pictorial tension: ""Actin' funny, but I don't know why/'Scuse me while I kiss the sky."" (Hendrix later said that he had written the lyrics after he'd had a dream in which he could walk underwater.) The Experience recorded ""Purple Haze"" across a series of sessions in January and February, 1967, experimenting with recording techniques such as the blitzed-out distortion on Hendrix's guitar — when the master tape was sent to their American record label, an enclosed note diligently pointed out that the distorted sound of the song was deliberate. In the closing solo, Hendrix echoed his screaming Strat with an additional shrieking guitar put through a new harmonic-manipulation device called an Octavia and played back at double speed. ""Purple Haze"" — the opening track on the U.S. version of his debut LP, Are You Experienced? — captured the liberating rush of Day-Glo culture just in time for the Summer of Love.",Are You Experienced? (Experience Hendrix) ,The Jimi Hendrix Experience,Hendrix,Chas Chandler,"March, 1967",8 weeks,No. 65
Maybellene,"Rock & roll guitar starts here. The pileup of hillbilly country, urban blues and hot jazz in Chuck Berry's electric twang is the primal language of pop- music guitar, and it's all perfected on his first single. The entire song is a two-minute chase scene packed with car-culture vernacular and Berry's hipster-lingo inventions (""As I was motorvatin' over the hill. . . .""). Its groove comes from ""Ida Red,"" a 1938 recording by Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys (of a song that dates back to the 19th century). By the time of the May 21st, 1955, session, Berry had been playing country tunes for black audiences for a few years — ""After they laughed at me a few times, they began requesting the hillbilly stuff,"" he has said. Leonard Chess came up with the title, inspired by a Maybelline mascara box lying on the floor at the Chess studio. DJ Alan Freed had nothing to do with writing ""Maybellene,"" although he got co-credit and royalties for years in return for radio airplay: payola in all but name.",The Anthology (Chess) ,Chuck Berry,Berry,Leonard and Phil Chess,"July, 1955",11 weeks,No. 5
Hound Dog,"""Hound Dog"" was a hit before Elvis Presley sang it, and he was famous for singing it before he recorded it. Written in 1952 by white teenagers Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller for R&B singer Willie Mae ""Big Mama"" Thornton, it was a smash for her, and was immediately covered by a handful of country acts. (The chorus, Leiber noted in 1987, was code for ""You ain't nothin' but a motherfucker."") Presley, always on the lookout for hillbilly/R&B crossover possibilities, added the song to his stage act in the spring of 1956, after hearing Freddie Bell and the Bellboys sing it in Las Vegas. On June 5th of that year, his hip-swiveling performance of ""Hound Dog"" on The Milton Berle Show became an instant sensation — notorious enough that on his next TV appearance, he crooned the song to a top-hatted basset hound. The next morning, Presley and his band got deadly serious about ""Hound Dog,"" perfecting it over 31 takes at New York's RCA Studios. With snarling vocal authority, D.J. Fontana's tommy-gun drumrolls and slashing guitar by Scotty Moore, Presley transformed the song's blues changes and put-down rhymes into a declaration of independence from his generation's cold, rigid elders. ""Hound Dog"" was the flip side of ""Don't Be Cruel,"" Presley's third RCA single. It was also the song in which he told the world: Like it or not, rock & roll is here to stay.",Elvis 30 #1 Hits (RCA) ,Elvis Presley,"Jerry Leiber, Mike Stoller",Steve Sholes,"July, 1956",28 weeks,No. 1
Let It Be,"Inspired by the church-born soul of Aretha Franklin, an anxious Paul McCartney started writing ""Let It Be"" in 1968, during the contentious sessions for the White Album. His opening lines — ""When I find myself in times of trouble/Mother Mary comes to me"" — were based on a dream in which his own late mother, Mary, offered solace during a tumultuous time for both the band and the culture, assuring him that everything would turn out fine. ""I'm not sure if she used the words 'Let it be,'"" McCartney recalled, ""but that was the gist of her advice."" McCartney unveiled a skeletal version of ""Let It Be"" to the other Beatles at an even worse time: during the initial, disastrous Let It Be rehearsals in January 1969. John Lennon, the group's resident heretic, was brutally dismissive, mistaking McCartney's secular humanism for self-righteous piety. Yet the Beatles put special labor into the song, getting the consummate take on January 31st — the day after their last live performance, on the roof of their Apple offices in London. (R&B musician Billy Preston, a friend of the band's from its early days, contributed the gospel-flavored organ part.) George Harrison later took a couple of cracks at adding a guitar solo: The single version features his solo from April 30th, 1969, and the album cut's solo was taped at the final Beatles recording session, on January 4th, 1970. Released four months later, ""Let It Be"" effectively became an elegy for the band that had defined the Sixties.",Let It Be (Capitol/Apple),The Beatles,"John Lennon, Paul McCartney",George Martin,"March, 1970",14 weeks,No. 1
Born to Run,"This song's four and a half minutes took three and a half months to cut. Aiming for the impact of Phil Spector's Wall of Sound, Springsteen included strings, glockenspiel, multiple keyboards — and more than a dozen guitar tracks. ""I had enormous ambitions for it,"" said Springsteen. ""I wanted to make the greatest rock record I'd ever heard."" Springsteen's lyrics told a story of young lovers on the highways of New Jersey.

Be My Baby,"Phil Spector rehearsed this song with Ronnie Bennett (the only Ronette to sing on it) for weeks, but that didn't stop him from doing 42 takes before he was satisfied. Aided by a full orchestra (as well as a young Cher, who sang backup vocals), Spector created a lush, echo-laden sound that was the Rosetta stone for studio pioneers such as the Beatles and Brian Wilson, who calls this his favorite song.

In My Life,"""''In My Life' was, I think, my first real, major piece of work,"" John Lennon said. ""Up until then it had all been glib and throwaway."" The ballad reflects the serious turn the Beatles took with Rubber Soul, but it specifically arose from a journalist's challenge: Why don't you write songs about your life? The original lyrics put Lennon on a bus in Liverpool, ""and it was the most boring sort of 'What I Did on My Holidays Bus Trip' song,"" he said. So Lennon rewrote the lyrics, changing the song into a gorgeous reminiscence about his life before the Beatles.

""It was music you listened to while you were preparing to go into battle."" Mayfield wrote the gospel-driven R&B ballad, he said, ""in a deep mood, a spiritual state of mind,"" just before Martin Luther King Jr.'s march on the Impressions' hometown of Chicago. Shortly after ""People Get Ready"" was released, churches in Chicago began including their own version of it in songbooks. Mayfield's version of the song ended with ""You don't need no ticket/You just thank the Lord,"" but the churches' rendition, ironically, made the lyrics less Christian and more universal: ""Everybody wants freedom/This I know.""",The Very Best of the Impressions (Rhino),The Impressions,Curtis Mayfield,Johnny Pate,"Jan, 1965",8 weeks,No. 14

Carl Wilson's understated lead vocal is note-perfect, but it's the arrangement of horns, sleigh bells, strings and accordion that gives ""God"" its heavenly feel. Brian Wilson was fascinated by spirituality and said this song came out of prayer sessions in the studio.

Stairway to Heaven,"All epic anthems must measure themselves against ""Stairway to Heaven,"" the cornerstone of Led Zeppelin IV. The acoustic intro sounds positively Elizabethan, thanks to John Paul Jones' recorder solo and Plant's fanciful lyrics, which were partly inspired by Lewis Spence's historical tome Magic Arts in Celtic Britain. Over eight minutes, the song morphs into a furious Page solo that storms heaven's gate. Page said the song ""crystallized the essence of the band. It had everything there and showed us at our best.

Recorded between four and seven in the morning, during the landmark Memphis session that helped return the King to his throne, ""Suspicious Minds"" â€” the final Number One single of his lifetime â€” is Presley's masterpiece: He sings so intensely through the fade-out that his band returns for another minute of the tear-stained chorus.",Elvis 30 #1 Hits (RCA) ,Elvis Presley,Mark James,"Chips Moman, Felton Jarvis, Presley","Sept. , 1969",15 weeks, No. 1

It was a breakthrough moment, Wilson has said, that led him to begin creating more complex, emotional music.

Papas Got A Brand New Bag,13 weeks; No. 8,"In mid-1965, Brown was locked in a contract struggle with King Records, but when he learned King was nearly bankrupt, he threw the label a bone: a song he'd recorded a few months earlier, yelling, ""This is a hit!"" as the tape rolled. Arguably the first funk record, it's driven by the empty space between beats as much as by Brown's bellow and guitarist Jimmy Nolen's ice-chipper scratch. In a stroke of postproduction genius (you can hear the original recording on the Grammy-winning Star Time box set), Brown sliced off the intro to have the song start with a face-smashing horn blast, and sped it up just enough so it sounded like an urgent bulletin from the future.",James Brown,Brown,Brown,"July , 1966",,
Walk On By,"Early in her career, Warwick was a back-up singer who also cut demos for Brill Building songwriters Bacharach and David. This forlorn classic solidified her stardom, capping a series of singles in which she played the pleading lover. A downcast ballad set to a bossa nova beat, it was originally relegated to the B side of ""Any Old Time of the Day,"" until New York DJ Murray the K asked listeners to vote on the single's two sides. The winning cut scaled the charts during the heady exuberance of Beatlemania, which provided an unwitting foil for the understated perseverance of ""Walk On By.""

Crying,"Orbison said he wrote this lush, dreamy ballad after an encounter with an old flame: ""Whether I was physically crying or just crying inside is the same thing."" His near-operatic performance culminated in a high, wailing note, which Orbison never lost the capacity to hit until his death in 1988. ""He sounded like he was singing from an Olympian mountaintop and he meant business,"" Bob Dylan wrote in Chronicles.

Tangled Up in Blue,"When Dylan introduced ""Tangled Up in Blue"" onstage in 1978, he described it as a song that took him ""10 years to live and two years to write."" It's still one of his most frequently performed live staples. It was the six-minute opener from Blood on the Tracks, written as his first marriage was falling apart. Dylan takes inspiration from classic country singers like Hank Williams and Lefty Frizzell, in a tale of a drifting heart on the road through the Sixties and Seventies.

""Jailhouse Rock"" was decidedly silly, the kind of tongue-in-cheek narrative goof they had been coming up with for the Coasters. The King, however, sang it as straight rock & roll, overlooking the humor in the lyrics (like the suggestion of gay romance when inmate Number 47 tells Number 3, ""You're the cutest jailbird I ever did see"") and introducing Scotty Moore's guitar solo with a cry so intense that the take almost collapses.",Elvis 30 #1 Hits (RCA) ,Elvis Presley,"Jerry Leiber, Mike Stoller",Steve Sholes,"Oct. , 1957","27 weeks, No. 1",

The track was also the only one recorded by the initial lineup of Procol Harum, which started as a British band, the Paramounts, in 1963.

""I didn't have any money to go after her, so there was nothing I could do to try and get her back,"" he later recalled.

Recorded between four and seven in the morning, during the landmark Memphis session that helped return the King to his throne, ""Suspicious Minds"" â€” the final Number One single of his lifetime â€” is Presley's masterpiece: He sings so intensely through the fade-out that his band returns for another minute of the tear-stained chorus.",Elvis 30 #1 Hits (RCA) ,Elvis Presley,Mark James,"Chips Moman, Felton Jarvis, Presley","Sept. , 1969",15 weeks, No. 1

You Really Got Me,"Convinced that the band's previous two singles had flopped because they were too pristine, the Kinks went into the studio in the summer of 1964 to record this deliberately raw rave-up, written by Ray Davies on the piano in his parents' living room. But the original recording still felt too shiny, and the band had to borrow 200 pounds to cover the cost of another session. Seventeen-year-old guitarist Dave Davies took a razor to the speaker cone on his amp to get the desired dirty sound for that immortal, blistering riff.

Everything else came from L.A. session players, including drummer Hal Blaine and bassist Larry Knechtel of Phil Spector's Wrecking Crew. But the rest of the Byrds soon caught up, and as the song was breaking, a curious Dylan checked out the band at Ciro's, a Los Angeles club.

Mystery Train,"""Mystery Train"" is one of Presley's most haunting songs, a stark blues number that sounds ancient but was actually first cut only two years before by Memphis blues singer Junior Parker. Presley recorded it with the groove from the flip side of the same Parker single, ""Love My Baby,"" and Sun producer Phillips' taut, rubbery echo effect made guitarist Scotty Moore's every note sound doubled. Presley added a final verse â€” ""Train . . . took my baby, but it never will again"" â€” capped by a celebratory falsetto whoop that transformed a pastoral about death into a song about the power to overcome it.",Sunrise (RCA) ,Elvis Presley,"Junior Parker, Sam Phillips",Phillips,"Sept. , 1955",Did not chart,
Strawberry Fields Forever,"Lennon often considered ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" his greatest accomplishment with the Beatles. The song, a surreal kaleidoscope of sound, was the first track recorded for Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (although it was released as a single instead). The lyrics are a nostalgic look at Lennon's Liverpool childhood and an expression of his own pride. Said Lennon, ""The second line goes, 'No one I think is in my tree.'

Whole Lotta Love,"The members of Led Zeppelin first got their sound together by jamming on blues standards, stretching them out into psychedelic orgies. ""Whole Lotta Love"" was a tribute to Chicago blues songwriter Willie Dixon, based on his ""You Need Love,"" a Muddy Waters single from 1962 (though Robert Plant also threw in quotes from songs Dixon wrote for Howlin' Wolf). The copyright issues weren't sorted out until 1985, when Dixon brought legal action and got his rightful share of the credit for ""Whole Lotta Love."" ""Page's riff was Page's riff,"" Plant said. ""I just thought, 'Well, what am I going to sing?' That was it, a nick. Now happily paid for."" Said Page, ""Usually my riffs are pretty damn original.

Superstition,"Wonder debuted this hard blast of funk live while opening for the Rolling Stones in the summer of 1972, intent on expanding his audience. The 22-year-old former child star had written it at the drum set, humming the other parts to himself.

It was a breakthrough moment, Wilson has said, that led him to begin creating more complex, emotional music. The lyrics, written by Love, were inspired by Wilson's assertion that ""everybody loves girls."" And despite the teen-fantasy theme, the singing is tougher than earlier Beach Boys hits, with tightly wound harmonies and an aggressive lead vocal.

Papas Got A Brand New Bag,13 weeks; No. 8,"In mid-1965, Brown was locked in a contract struggle with King Records, but when he learned King was nearly bankrupt, he threw the label a bone: a song he'd recorded a few months earlier, yelling, ""This is a hit!"" as the tape rolled. Arguably the first funk record, it's driven by the empty space between beats as much as by Brown's bellow and guitarist Jimmy Nolen's ice-chipper scratch. In a stroke of postproduction genius (you can hear the original recording on the Grammy-winning Star Time box set), Brown sliced off the intro to have the song start with a face-smashing horn blast, and sped it up just enough so it sounded like an urgent bulletin from the future.",James Brown,Brown,Brown,"July , 1966",,
Walk On By,"Early in her career, Warwick was a back-up singer who also cut demos for Brill Building songwriters Bacharach and David. This forlorn classic solidified her stardom, capping a series of singles in which she played the pleading lover. A downcast ballad set to a bossa nova beat, it was originally relegated to the B side of ""Any Old Time of the Day,"" until New York DJ Murray the K asked listeners to vote on the single's two sides. The winning cut scaled the charts during the heady exuberance of Beatlemania, which provided an unwitting foil for the understated perseverance of ""Walk On By.""

Crying,"Orbison said he wrote this lush, dreamy ballad after an encounter with an old flame: ""Whether I was physically crying or just crying inside is the same thing."" His near-operatic performance culminated in a high, wailing note, which Orbison never lost the capacity to hit until his death in 1988. ""He sounded like he was singing from an Olympian mountaintop and he meant business,"" Bob Dylan wrote in Chronicles.

Tangled Up in Blue,"When Dylan introduced ""Tangled Up in Blue"" onstage in 1978, he described it as a song that took him ""10 years to live and two years to write."" It's still one of his most frequently performed live staples. It was the six-minute opener from Blood on the Tracks, written as his first marriage was falling apart. Dylan takes inspiration from classic country singers like Hank Williams and Lefty Frizzell, in a tale of a drifting heart on the road through the Sixties and Seventies. Dylan kept revising the song heavily through the years; on his 1984 Real Live, he plays with the chords and lyrics to tell a whole new story.",Blood on the Tracks (Columbia) ,Bob Dylan,Dylan,Dylan,"Jan. , 1975","7 weeks, No. 31",
Jailhouse Rock,"Songwriters Leiber and Stoller had already penned a couple of Presley hits â€” most notably ""Hound Dog,"" picked up from blues belter Big Mama Thornton â€” but the theme song for Presley's third movie was the duo's first studio collaboration with the young superstar. ""Jailhouse Rock"" was decidedly silly, the kind of tongue-in-cheek narrative goof they had been coming up with for the Coasters. The King, however, sang it as straight rock & roll, overlooking the humor in the lyrics (like the suggestion of gay romance when inmate Number 47 tells Number 3, ""You're the cutest jailbird I ever did see"") and introducing Scotty Moore's guitar solo with a cry so intense that the take almost collapses.",Elvis 30 #1 Hits (RCA) ,Elvis Presley,"Jerry Leiber, Mike Stoller",Steve Sholes,"Oct. , 1957","27 weeks, No. 1",

Sunshine of Your Love,"Bassist Bruce and lyricist-poet Brown came up with ""Sunshine"" toward the end of an all-night session, which inspired the opening line: ""It's getting near dawn/When lights close their tired eyes."" The killer riff was inspired by Jimi Hendrix and based on a bass ostinato from Bruce; Clapton added the chorus hook, and drummer Ginger Baker laid down a mammoth, tom-tom-heavy beat. Bruce knew ""Sunshine"" would do well, but Atlantic Records nearly rejected it until some of the label's biggest acts started championing the record. ""Both Booker T.

But what really made ""Whole Lotta Shakin' Going On"" work was producer Cowboy Jack Clement's decision to turn the session over to the manic energy of Lewis' live shows.

The track was also the only one recorded by the initial lineup of Procol Harum, which started as a British band, the Paramounts, in 1963.

""I didn't have any money to go after her, so there was nothing I could do to try and get her back,"" he later recalled.

Like Little Richard â€” what does he mean? You can't take him apart; that's rock & roll to me.""",Moondance (Warner Bros.),Van Morrison,Morrison,Morrison,"March , 1970",Non-Single,
Welcome to the Jungle,"Slash's Seventies-metal crunch and Axl's hell-bound shriek brought brutal realism to the L.A. glam-metal scene. ""They're real-life stories, these fuckin' songs,"" bassist Duff McKagan said.

Runaway,"As a kid, Shannon got his first guitar for $5. His truck-driver dad wasn't too happy about it. ""'You get that goddamn guitar outta here' â€” that's the exact words my father used,"" Shannon recalled. ""However, my ma said, 'It's OK, son. You can sing for me.'""

Rain,"The B side of â€œPaperback Writerâ€ was Lennonâ€˜s response to people moaning about the wet British weather. It featured one of the earliest uses of backward tape, which Lennon said was the result of being stoned and spooling up the tape wrong.

Respect Yourself,"Stax singer Ingram, frustrated with the state of the world, told house songwriter Rice that ""black folk need to learn to respect themselves.""

Big Pimpin,"For this thumping ode to conspicuous consumption, the king of New York rap hooked up with Houston rap dons UGK over a beat that sounds like it was cut in Cairo.

Get Ur Freak On,"Elliott was convinced that Miss E needed one more track.

Rollin Stone,"For Chess Records' first single, Waters turned Mississippi bluesman Robert Petway's ""Catfish Blues"" into a spare track he named ""Rollin' Stone.""

Soul Man,"For the follow-up to ""Hold On, I'm Comin',"" writer-producers Hayes and Porter decided to tinker with their formula: Porter asked singer Sam Moore to give him ""the Bobby Bland squall,"" guitarist Steve Cropper came up with the licks that set up the familiar blast of the Memphis Horns, and â€” voilÃ ! â€” another soul classic was born.

All Apologies,"Written in the L.A. apartment Cobain shared with Courtney Love, this haunting meditation on remorse was originally produced by punk malcontent Albini, but then R.E.M. producer Scott Litt was brought in to smooth it out â€” the original had a long stream of feedback on it.

Sheena Is a Punk Rocker,"This was cut twice: first as a single that was rushed to radio and became one of the Ramones' few modest hits, then in a slightly souped-up version for the band's album Rocket to Russia.

Paradise City,"For nearly seven minutes, Axl Rose expounds on the joys of green grass, pretty girls and toxic chemicals. The song was written in the back of a van as the band drove home to L.A. after a gig in San Francisco, with all the members tossing in lines.

Cupid,"Cooke's producers had asked him to write a song for a girl they had seen on a Perry Como TV show â€” but once they heard her sing, they kept ""Cupid"" for Cooke to do himself.

Heroin,"This seven-minute, two-chord track spiked out its territory with lyrics about shooting up until you felt like Jesus' son. ""It wasn't pro or con,"" Reed said.

Come As You Are,"""It's just about people and what they're expected to act like,"" Cobain said. ""The lines in the song are really contradictory. They're kind of a rebuttal to each other."" The song is driven by a simple riff that Vig goosed with a flanged, subaquatic guitar effect. Cobain apparently lifted it from a 1985 song by U.K. art-metal band Killing Joke, whom Dave Grohl paid back 12 years later by drumming on their 2003 album.",Nevermind (Geffen),Nirvana,"Kurt Cobain, Nirvana","Butch Vig, Nirvana","Sept. , 1991",18 weeks, No. 32
I Got You Babe,"Late one night, while Sonny and Cher were living in their manager's house, Bono woke up Cher and asked her to listen to ""I Got You Babe"" and to sing the lyrics, which he had written on a piece of shirt cardboard.
